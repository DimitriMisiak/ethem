ETHEM module
(stands for Electro-THermal Model)

Reproduce step-by-step the thinking and resolution scheme of the electro-thermal model of a bolometer
(see page 129 of notebook 2017-2018)

- Heavy insparation from the dees and omnitool (might even continue omnitool here)
- Better fractionning of the functions
- Different methods of resolution available for adaptability, completeness and checking results :
	-> Numerical / Symbolic
	-> 1st order perturbative / absolute numerical
	-> temporal equations / frequency equation
- No GUI for now, waiting for operationnal and much more advanced module
- Use of config file to store numerical value, parameters, save configuration
- Independant from any analysis method, but meant to be useable by it (PTMCMC, minimizer, etc..)
- Script and test in different files, but saved together to keep track

Life is like a box of chocolate.
Well, not entirely but you get the idea.
Anyway, stop reading above my shoulder !
